==Types de documents==

  * Documents qui traitent d’évènements et non actualités (sauf si on veut des articles “intéressants” : Problème sur la prédictivité des informations (agenda ET articles ?) ;
  * Durée de vie d’une information ? Penser à supprimer les infos en trop, périmées...
  * Catégories, en rapport avec un lieu et une date :
    ** Actualités (société, politique, économie, international, technologies) ;
    ** Évènements importants (traffic info ?) ;
    ** Loisirs (culture, sport) ;
    ** Shopping 

==Sources pour les actualités==

  * Journaux locaux :
    ** http://www.20minutes.fr/ville/Lyon
    ** http://www.lyoncapitale.fr/

 * Newsletter/flux RSS
  * ex: http://www.groupon.fr/deals/lyon
Q: pb de copyright
 * Service web API
  * ex: http://developer.shopping.com/
 * page web brut
  * utiliser l'expression rationnelle pour faire le filtrage de document(plus compliqué mais intéressant. A réfléchir !)
